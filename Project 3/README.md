# Project 3: Classification Algorithms

### Implemented:
* 3 classification algorithms: Nearest Neighbor Decision Tree, and Na√Øve Bayes.
* Implement Random Forests based on implementation of Decision Tree.
* Implement Boosting based on implementation of Decision Tree.
* Adopt 10-fold Cross Validation to evaluate the performance of all methods on the provided two datasets in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-1 measure.

The code and datasets are in the respective folders.
